# AI-Mediated Feedback in MOOC Case Study

This repository serves as the **main entry point** for our study on AI-mediated feedback in a MOOC case study (submitted to LAK 2026).  
The project investigates whether personalized, AI-generated feedback improves learners‚Äô self-efficacy, motivation, feedback perception, and performance in SQL and machine learning tasks.  

## üìö Context
The intervention was implemented in the MITx *Supply Chain Technology and Systems* MOOC.  
Learners worked on a case study involving SQL queries and machine learning tasks.  
- **Control group**: received static, pre-authored explanations.  
- **Treatment group**: received real-time, AI-generated personalized feedback.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Notes
The AI-mediated feedback was implemented using **Streamlit apps**, each corresponding to a case study question.  
- Learners in the Treatment group interacted with these apps, which provided **real-time, AI-generated feedback**.  
- Apps were then **embedded into the edX platform** via iframes, so learners could complete the exercises seamlessly inside the MOOC environment.
